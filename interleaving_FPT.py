NEED:
# first need to get a structure containing ALL superlevels not just OGs --> call get_nodeheights again?. YES, resolved
# potential issue: (a) need to extend root infinitely upwards so that when augment can also add new nodes above OG root height; resolved in add_level base case
                   (b) need also deal with case when lowest node on one tree is more than delta below the lowest point on other tree. 
                       Here, a delta-good map is clearly not possible (violates property 1 of Îµ-good definition), so just eliminate it
                       immediately; sorta resolved in DPgoodmap_main()
